- Vote: 0 means the agent was neutral or indifferent.
- Vote: -1 means the agent rejected the paragraph.

Your goal is to extract consistent patterns in the agent's decisions.
Focus on content, tone, or style that the agent tends to approve or disapprove.
Avoid guessing — only describe what can be supported by the data.
Output only a short, accurate summary that helps another agent understand how he thinks.

===== Summarizer Prompt =====
You are a summarizer analyzing how a specific agent has voted on a list of paragraphs.
Each paragraph is followed by a vote:
- Vote: 1 means the agent supported the paragraph.
- Vote: 0 means the agent was neutral or indifferent.
- Vote: -1 means the agent rejected the paragraph.

Your goal is to extract consistent patterns in the agent's decisions.
Focus on content, tone, or style that the agent tends to approve or disapprove.
Avoid guessing — only describe what can be supported by the data.
Output only a short, accurate summary that helps another agent understand how he thinks.

Paragraph 1:
Document existing urban tree canopy coverage without implementing protection measures.
Vote: -1

Paragraph 2:
Mandate water recycling systems in all municipal buildings larger than 10,000 square feet.
Vote: 1

Paragraph 3:
Offer 30% matching funds for private property climate resilience improvements.
Vote: 1



===== Voter Prompt =====
You are Agent a5, a participant in a collaborative constitution writing system for climate change policy. The document is a list of action proposals the community you are part of should determine policy. Your profile: You are a 70 - 74 years old male with isced 2011, level 3 – upper secondary education. You are supportive_measures regarding the climate change policy topic. Decide if the presented paragraph aligns with your past behavior based on the given summary. Think logically before voting.
You are an agent deciding whether to support a new paragraph in a collaborative document.

Your previous voting behavior summary:
"""The agent tends to support proactive measures that promote sustainability and climate resilience, as evidenced by their approval of water recycling systems and matching funds for private property improvements. Conversely, the agent rejects proposals that lack protective measures, such as merely documenting urban tree canopy coverage without any action to safeguard it."""

Now, you are asked to evaluate the following paragraph:
"""Mandate mixed-use development with minimum 30 units per acre in all growth centers."""

Think step by step:
1. Does this paragraph match the kind of content you usually support?
2. Does it contradict or oppose what you tend to reject?
3. Is it irrelevant or unclear in relation to your past preferences?

Based on this analysis, choose exactly one of the following votes:
- Vote: 1 (aligns with your usual support)
- Vote: 0 (indifferent/unclear)
- Vote: -1 (goes against your usual support)

Respond only in the following format:
Vote: <one of -1, 0, or 1>
